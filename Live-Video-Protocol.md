**How to set up a live video stream:**

1) download the video encoder [Xsplit Broadcaster](https://www.xsplit.com/broadcaster/download).

2) set up account, or login via social media account.

**First, let's set up a scene**

We can define our broadcast by establishing a series of scenes, which are in turn made up of a series of media types. Click on the "Scene 1" button at the bottom right.

* let's add a webcam feed to Scene 1. To do this, Add >> Devices >> Video >> Webcam (your active webcam)

* a live webcam feed should be visible. Stretch and move the image as desired. Now let's add a Desktop feed. Go to Add >> Screen Capture. A crosshairs should appear on your Desktop. Click once on the desired action (process such as a web browser) you want to capture. 

* your window should be visible in Scene 1 as well. Stretch and move the image as desired.

* Don't forget an audio feed. To select the microphone, go to Tools >> Learning >> Settings >> Audio tab >> Microphone (--). Click on Apply button.

**Adding in capture from running windows**  

You can also add in specific windows representing running processes (e.g. Firefox, Slack). To do this, click on the "sources" button at the lower left (at the bottom of the scene composition dialogue box). Choose Screen Capture >> Window Capture, and then choose your windows of choice. You will want to add one Scene per window. 

An alternative method to streaming and video capture is the following:

1) add source to an XSplit scene. Select Screen Capture >> Window Capture >> Google Chrome.

2) modify settings for Scene 1: uncheck "exclusive window capture".

3) you will see a nested screen until the browser window is overlapping the main screen. You can record and save locally, or stream to YouTube.

**Now, let's broadcast!**

To set up a new output, select Outputs >> New Output. You can select from live streams such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Twitch. YouTube and Facebook are known to work pretty seamlessly, and can be configured to your own account. Go through the details for each option. 

* before you broadcast live, test your template out by recording locally. To do this, go to Outputs >> Local Recording.

* once you are done with the live stream, the video should be saved to your timeline (Facebook) or video list (YouTube). Go to your Facebook or YouTube account to archive and share as desired.
