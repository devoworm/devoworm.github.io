      <description>&amp;ldquo;Darwin as an Embryo&amp;rdquo;. In this case, Neoteny really does recapitulates Phylogeny COURTESY: Stable Diffusion.
For this year&amp;rsquo;s delayed Darwin Day post, I will present some of the latest work on ancient embryos which we have been discussing in the DevoWorm group meetings. While this is by no means a complete review, we will discuss the earliest fossil evidence for eggs, embryos, and nervous systems (in animals, not plants), in addition to the conditions that lead to their emergence.</description>

      <description>The Learning on Graphs (LoG) conference took place from December 9-12 and featured a broad diversity of research on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs [1] encompass a relatively new area of machine learning research which have a number of interesting connections to applied math and network science. The daily sessions (keynote talks and oral presentations), in addition to the seven workshop sessions, are available from the conference YouTube channel.
GNNs are a way to take data that yield graphical relationships in the real world and analyze then using the power of neural networks.</description>

      <description>2021 has been a busy year for the DevoLearn initiative. Not only has Mayukh Deb been busy maintaining and generating new versions of the DevoLearn pre-trained model, but I (Bradly Alicea) has been engaging in technology evangelism to advance awareness and involvement in the initiative. The DevoLearn pre-trained model software (for C. elegans embryogenesis) is now at version 0.3.0, and has garnered 12 contributors making 165 commits (largely since January 2021).</description>

      <description>Accelerate data driven developmental biology research with computational learning models With Google Summer of Code 2020 almost complete, we can debut our latest endeavor: DevoLearn! DevoLearn is a platform that incorporates a computational analysis platform for embryos of different species, with an annotated collection of secondary datasets (DevoZoo) and educational tools.
While the first part (DevoLearn 0.2.0) is brand new, the other two components (species-specific models and DevoZoo) are revamped versions of resources we have created over the course of the past three years.</description>

      <description>Authors: Bradly Alicea, Richard Gordon, Abraham Kohrmann, Jesse Parent, Vinay Varma This content is cross-posted to The Node, Developmental Biology blog.
Our virtual discussion group (DevoWormML) has been exploring a number of topics related to the use of pre-trained models in machine learning (specifically deep learning). Pre-trained models such as GPT-2 [1], pix2pix [2], and OpenPose [3] are used for analyzing many specialized types of data (linguistics, image to image translation, and human body features, respectively) and have a number of potential uses for the analysis of biological data in particular.</description>

      <description>Last year, I attended a workshop at the University of Illinois-Chicago called &amp;ldquo;Finding Your Inner Modeler&amp;rdquo;. Sponsored by the NSF, FYIM is meant to bring together biologists and modelers and to foster collaborations between the two. There were many interesting talks over the course of two days, including plant biology, biochemical kinetics, and (of course) various types of computational and statistical model [1].
This year was the second installment of FYIM, and this time I was chosen for a platform presentation.</description>

      <description>Worm images courtesy of the OpenWorm browser (Drs. Christian Grove and Padraig Gleeson) Regular readers of this blog might recall that the OpenWorm Foundation spearheaded a workshop (From Connectome to Behavior) at the Royal Society (London) in January 2018. This workshop generated a lot of social media content and internal (to OpenWorm Slack) discussion of the presented topics.
Since then, the participants have been hard at work putting together a special issue (now live in Royal Society B) that presents in more detail what was discussed at the meeting.</description>

      <description>This week, the Royal Society is hosting a workshop called &amp;ldquo;From Connectome to Behavior&amp;rdquo;, hosted by the OpenWorm Foundation. A program can be found here.
The Monday and Tuesday sessions included talks by OpenWorm senior contributors as well as mathematical, biological, and engineering researchers from around the world (including John White, a C. elegans research legend). Fortunately, you can get a taste for the topical diversity on the OpenWorm Twitter feed, and from the screenshots below.</description>

      <description>The DevoWorm group has two new students that will be working over this summer on topics in computational embryogenesis. To begin their projects, I have asked each student to prepare a short presentation based on their original proposal, which serves as a variant of the traditional &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; program. We will then compare this talk with one they will give at the end of the summer to evaluate their learning and accomplishment trajectory.</description>

      <description>In the past year, I have been starting to use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm) as a model organism. Not only have I helped to establish the DevoWorm project, I am also starting to engage with C. elegans in a wet-lab setting. As a consequence, I am learning about multiple facets of C. elegans biology. C. elegans is a well-established model organism, having well-characterized neural and developmental systems. The nervous system contains just 302 cells, with a full accounting of the connectome (synaptic connections) [1].</description>
