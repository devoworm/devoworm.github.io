**How to extract the frames from a video using VLC**

VLC media player (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) has the ability to extract the frames from a video and will handle virtually anything you can throw at it. This tutorial will show you how.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Create a folder to store your frames and copy the path to it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Click Tools -> Preferences in VLC.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Under “show settings”, click “all”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Under “Video”, select “Filters”. In the menu on the right, tick checkbox “Scene video filter”. Click on “save”.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Expand “Filters” and select “Scene filter”. Modify the dialogue box on the right.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Paste the path from earlier into “directory path prefix”. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Decide what proportion of the frames you want to export. A value of “1” extracts all frames in the video.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Set image type as “jpg”. Image types such as “png” or “bmp” only sporadically provide usable files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Click “Save”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Open video in VLC. Right click, and choose “Run as Administrator”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Click Media -> Open Video and find your video. Patiently let the whole thing play.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Click Tools -> Preferences. Under “show settings”, click “all”. Under “video”, select “filters”. Uncheck “Scene video filter”. Click “Save”. This is so that VLC won’t generate thumbnails the next time you play a video.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Open the folder you created earlier. The thumbnails should be there.
